/*
An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has public static final constant variable
and abstract methods only.

The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve fully abstraction.
It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.

Why use Java interface?
It is used to achieve fully abstraction.
By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

loose coupling means -> as required you can define the body of the methods.
