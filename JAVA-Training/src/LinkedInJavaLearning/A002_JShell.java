What is JShell?
JShell is introduced in JAVA 9, and it still to continue in higher versions.
JShell lives in the terminal or similar shell environment
allows to see the result of code immediately
it is great for testing the code.

to open the jshell in cmd, just open the cmd and hit enter after typing jshell.
/help is used to learn more about the things.

in JShell, each evaluated lines of code has a number associated with it.
So lets say we created a variable but didn't give it a variable name automatically be a variable name with a dollar sign and that associated number.

in jshell write 16+16 and hit enter.

16 + 16
$4 ==> 32

to access that 32, just type $4 and hit enter
