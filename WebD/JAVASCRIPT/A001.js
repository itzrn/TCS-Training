There are three main components in web dev
1. HTML (skeleton)
2. CSS (Beautification)
3. JS (Brain) the functionalty is because of js

The original purpose the JS was developed for the execution with in web browser.
So, js code is executed by JS engine and every browser have its own js engine to execute js code.
like google chrome have V8(written in c++) engine, firefox have spider monkey, microsoft edge have chakra and safari have JS code

using inspect we can access the console on web browser.

Yes originally JS was built to execute on web browser, but now we can also run it on
our own local system i.e. node.js come into talk.

node js is simply a JS run time environment. Developed to run the js code outside the web browser.
As we know to run js we need js engine, so node.js(written in c++) is built on top of the same js engine whcih is available in we browser.
